# Picrypt
Hides files in image's color data

## Welcome to Picrypt
In Picrypt, you can choose a file and an image from your computer and it will encrypt the file contents and hide the data within the color data of an image. As long as the file isn't too large compared to the image, you should not see any noticable distortion in the new image.

## Setup
Picrypt needs maven to build. Doing a simple "mvn clean install" will build it.
