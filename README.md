# Picrypt
Hides files in image's color data

## Welcome to Picrypt
In Picrypt, you can choose a file and an image from your computer and it will encrypt the file contents and hide the data within the color data of an image. As long as the file isn't too large compared to the image, you should not see any noticable distortion in the new image.

## Setup
Picrypt needs maven to build. Doing a simple "mvn clean install" will build it.

## TODO
There are some updates that I would like to make to this project in the future. But if anyone else would like to help out, I would appreciate any effort that you can give to this project. The most important update I would like to add is the ability to hide and extract data from an image without loading the entire image into memeory. This will save memory in case anyone uses a very large image.
